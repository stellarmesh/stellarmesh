Geometry construction
---------------------

Stellarmesh supports both
`build123d <https://github.com/gumyr/build123d>`__ (recommended) and
`CadQuery <https://github.com/CadQuery/cadquery>`__ for geometry
construction but does not depend on either.

The included examples use build123d, which can be installed from
`conda-forge <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/build123d>`__.
