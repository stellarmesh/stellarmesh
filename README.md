:warning: Stellarmesh is now a community project. Breaking changes are expected until version 1.0

:warning: See [logging](#logging) to enable logging output when using Jupyter.

Stellarmesh is a meshing library for nuclear workflows. Principally, it supports the creation of DAGMC geometry from CAD models. Stellarmesh is developed by the original authors of [Thea-Energy/stellarmesh](https://github.com/Thea-Energy/stellarmesh), [CAD-to-DAGMC](https://github.com/fusion-energy/cad_to_dagmc), and [CAD-to-OpenMC](https://github.com/openmsr/CAD_to_OpenMC).


**Features**:

- [x] Import of [CadQuery](https://github.com/CadQuery/cadquery), [build123d](https://github.com/gumyr/build123d), STEP and BREP geometry
- [x] Correct implementation of surface-sense
- [x] Imprinting and merging of conformal geometry
- [x] Mesh refinement
- [x] Automated testing and integration
- [x] Programatic manipulation of .h5m tags e.g. materials

See the project [Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/stellarmesh/projects/1).

# Installation
```sh
pip install stellarmesh
```

or install the development version with:

```sh
pip install build123d
```

*Note: Stellarmesh requires an installation of [MOAB](https://bitbucket.org/fathomteam/moab) with pymoab, which is not available on PyPi and must be installed either from source or using Conda.*

# Usage
## Geometry construction
Stellarmesh supports both [build123d](https://github.com/gumyr/build123d) (recommended) and [CadQuery](https://github.com/CadQuery/cadquery) for geometry construction but does not depend on either.

The included examples use build123d. To install, run:

```python
pip install git+https://github.com/gumyr/build123d
```

For documentation and usage examples, see [Read the Docs](https://build123d.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Examples

### Simple torus geometry
```python
import build123d as bd
import stellarmesh as sm

solids = [bd.Solid.make_torus(1000, 100)]
for _ in range(3):
    solids.append(solids[-1].faces()[0].thicken(100))
solids = solids[1:]

geometry = sm.Geometry(solids, material_names=["a", "a", "c"])
mesh = sm.Mesh.from_geometry(geometry, min_mesh_size=50, max_mesh_size=50)
mesh.write("test.msh")
mesh.render("doc/torus-mesh-reversed.png", rotation_xyz=(90, 0, -90), normals=15)

h5m = sm.DAGMCModel.from_mesh(mesh)
h5m.write("dagmc.h5m")
h5m.write("dagmc.vtk")
```

## Logging
Stellarmesh uses the logging library for debug, info and warning messages. Set the level with:

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig() # Required in Jupyter to correctly set output stream
logging.getLogger("stellarmesh").setLevel(logging.INFO)
```

## Mesh refinement
*Note: given CAD geometry, Gmsh often produces high-quality meshes that do not benefit from remeshing.*

Stellarmesh supports mesh refinement using the [mmg](https://www.mmgtools.org/) library. Refine a mesh with:

```python
refined_mesh = mesh.refine(
  ...
)
```
and consult the `Mesh.refine` and [mmgs](https://www.mmgtools.org/mmg-remesher-try-mmg/mmg-remesher-tutorials/mmg-remesher-mmg2d/mesh-adaptation-to-a-solution) documentations for parameter values.

Many thanks to [Erik B. Knudsen](https://github.com/ebknudsen) for his work on remeshing for [CAD-to-OpenMC](https://github.com/openmsr/CAD_to_OpenMC).
