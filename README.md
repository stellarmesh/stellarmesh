[![Tests](https://github.com/stellarmesh/stellarmesh/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/stellarmesh/stellarmesh/actions/workflows/test.yml)

Stellarmesh is a meshing library for nuclear workflows. Principally, it supports the creation of DAGMC geometry from CAD models.


**Features**:

- [x] Import of [CadQuery](https://github.com/CadQuery/cadquery), [build123d](https://github.com/gumyr/build123d), STEP and BREP geometry
- [x] Surface and volume meshing
- [x] Gmsh and OpenCASCADE meshing backends
- [x] Linear and angular mesh tolerances
- [x] Imprinting and merging of conformal geometry
- [x] Mesh refinement
- [x] Programatic manipulation of .h5m tags
- [x] Automated testing and integration

# Installation

Stellarmesh requires several dependencies that must be installed either from source or from conda-forge. At a minimum, these are `moab`, `python-gmsh`, and `OCP`. However, most users will likely also want `build123d` for geometry construction and `openmc` for simulation. See [environment.yml](environment.yml) for a sample conda environment.

From there, Stellarmesh can be installed from PyPI.

```sh
pip install stellarmesh
```

> [!WARNING]
> While OCP and Gmsh can both be installed from PyPI, they are not ABI compatible. Usage of these packages will result in errors for some geometries.

# Usage

For documentation and usage examples, see the [examples](examples/) and [tutorials](tutorials/) folders.

## Geometry construction
Stellarmesh supports both [build123d](https://github.com/gumyr/build123d) (recommended) and [CadQuery](https://github.com/CadQuery/cadquery) for geometry construction but does not depend on either.

The included examples use build123d, which can be installed from [conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/build123d).


## Meshing

Stellarmesh supports surface meshing with both OCC and Gmsh backends.

### OCC

The OpenCASCADE (OCC) meshing backend is the preferred backend when linear or angular mesh tolerances are required.

### Gmsh

The Gmsh meshing backend offers a number of meshing algorithms for both surface and volume meshes. For more detailed documentation, see [gmsh.info](https://gmsh.info/doc/texinfo/gmsh.html).

## Example

### Simple torus geometry
```python
import build123d as bd
import stellarmesh as sm

solids = [bd.Solid.make_torus(1000, 100)]
for _ in range(3):
    solids.append(bd.Solid.thicken(solids[-1].faces()[0], 100))
solids = solids[1:]

geometry = sm.Geometry(solids[::-1], material_names=["a", "a", "c"])
mesh = sm.SurfaceMesh.from_geometry(
    geometry, sm.GmshSurfaceOptions(min_mesh_size=50, max_mesh_size=200)
)
mesh.write("test.msh")
mesh.render("doc/torus-mesh-reversed.png", rotation_xyz=(90, 0, -90), normals=15)

h5m = sm.DAGMCModel.from_mesh(mesh)
h5m.write("dagmc.h5m")
h5m.write("dagmc.vtk")
```

## Logging
Stellarmesh uses the logging library for debug, info and warning messages. Set the level with:

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig() # Required in Jupyter to correctly set output stream
logging.getLogger("stellarmesh").setLevel(logging.INFO)
```

## Mesh refinement
> [!NOTE]
> Given CAD geometry, Gmsh often produces high-quality meshes that do not benefit from remeshing.

Stellarmesh supports mesh refinement using the [mmg](https://www.mmgtools.org/) library. Refine a mesh with:

```python
refined_mesh = mesh.refine(
  ...
)
```
and consult the `Mesh.refine` and [mmgs](https://www.mmgtools.org/mmg-remesher-try-mmg/mmg-remesher-tutorials/mmg-remesher-mmg2d/mesh-adaptation-to-a-solution) documentations for parameter values.
